# JUET-Builds-2022

We are working on building a decentralized app(Dapp) named 'अश्वस्थ' which helps to find out early signs of depression among people through their chat messages using a sentiment analysis model of emotion recognition.

## The problem अश्वस्थ solves
We are the Generation of Stress. We are, more than seemingly ever before, dissatisfied by our realities. People are getting stressed out even about small things happening with them. This much of stress and anxiety eventually leads them to depression and even suicides.To help this at-risk population, we decided to create this platform!

## Challenges we ran into
Learning and implementing Gun.js and sentiment analysis model, and integrating them in our code along with Node.js and JavaScript was quite a task, but we did that successfully. Through our model we have achieved an accuracy of 94%, which is good but we are trying to improve it. We also have to make the chat app much more user friendly.

## Technologies we used
- Svelte
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Gun.js
- TensorFlow
- Python
- HTML/CSS
- TFlite
- Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
